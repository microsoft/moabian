# Troubleshooting

## Unable to balance ball

If your Moab is not able to balance a ball in PID or BRAIN1 mode, we recommend the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your lighting situation. Are there any objects or lights in the room that Moab could be mistaking for orange ping pong balls? You can check by viewing the camera stream. Follow the directions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/moabian/blob/docs-update/docs/view-camera-stream.md). 
       
     If this is the case try moving Moab to another location, blocking the lights, or changing the lighting situation.

2. Calibrate the ball hue and position. These instructions can be found on the [Calibration](https://github.com/microsoft/moabian/blob/docs-v3-updates/docs/calibration.md) page. If calibrating the ball hue and position does not solve the problem, complete the Servo Offset calibration as well.

3. If your Moab is still having trouble after calibrating, try using different colored balls, such as [these](https://www.amazon.com/STIGA-Assorted-Multicolor-Recreational-Quality-Regulation/dp/B000GF6030/ref=sr_1_20?dchild=1&keywords=ping+pong+balls+color&qid=1617201019&sr=8-20).

3. If your Moab is still unable to balance a ball after following the steps above, please contact us for troubleshooting assistance.
