# Troubleshooting

If your Moab is not able to balance a ball in PID or BRAIN1 mode, we recommend the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your lighting situation. Are there any objects or lights in
       the room that Moab could be mistaking for orange ping pong balls? You can check by viewing the camera stream. Follow the directions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/moabian/blob/docs-update/docs/view-camera-stream.md). If this is the case try moving Moab to another location, blocking the lights, or changing the lighting situation. You could also try using a different ball color.

2. Calibrate the camera. Move the joystick down and select
       "CALIBRATE". Follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate
       the camera to recognize the color of the ball.  

3. If your Moab is still unable to balance a ball after following
       the steps above, please contact us for a troubleshooting guide.
