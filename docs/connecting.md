# Connecting to Moab

To deploy your own brain on Moab, you will need to connect to it on your
local network. For the initial setup, we recommend using an ethernet
cable to connect your Moab to your local network. If you are unable to
connect to your network with an ethernet cable you can do so using WiFi.
To configure the WiFi on your Moab, you will need an HDMI monitor and
USB keyboard.

## Option 1: Connecting with an ethernet cable

Connect one end of an ethernet cable to your Moab and the other end to
your router.
