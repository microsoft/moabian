# Moab Calibration

Moab calibration consists of 3 components:

- Ball Hue: This is the color hue used by OpenCV to detect the ball. The default calibration is for the orange ball but the hue can change based on the lighting. If your Moab is having difficulty balancing the ball, try recalibrating to ensure proper ball detection.

- Ball Position: Each Moab is slightly different due to tolerances in the parts so this calibration determines the X and Y offsets to the center of the ball on the plate.

- Servo Offset: These are the servo offsets that determine a level plate. Since there are three servos, there are three offset values.

## Ball Hue and Position Calibration

These calibration values are updated in one step. It is important to perform this step as soon as you setup your Moab or if you move it to a new location since it is affected by the lighting.

1. In the menu, navigate to and select CALIBRATION. Follow the prompts on the Moab screen. If calibration is successful, the Ball Hue value will be displayed.

You can always view the hue value on your Moab by navigating to and selecting HUE INFO.

## Servo Offset (plate level) calibration

The servo offset calibration is a bit more advanced and is only necessary to do if your Moab is having trouble balancing the ball or the plate visibly needs to be leveled. It is important to complete the Ball Hue and Position calibration step before following this procedure. [Connecting](https://github.com/microsoft/moabian/blob/docs-v3-updates/docs/connecting.md) to your Moab is a prerequisite to this procedure.



1. To check the level of the plate, navigate to and select JOYSTICK. Place the ball on the center of the plate and observe where it rolls off the plate. If the ball does not roll, but stays in place, your plate is level and you do not need to complete this calibration.

2. SSH into Moab (see instructions in previous section)

3. Navigate to the moab/sw folder (`cd moab/sw`) and run the plate level  program (`p level_plate.py`). The three numbers in the program correspond to the three servo offsets. Use increase or decrease the offsets, the `u` and `j` keys for the first offset, the `i` and `k` keys for the second, and the `o` and `l` keys for the thrid. As you ajust the offsets you should see the plate move.

4. Update the servo offset values until the plate is level. You can verify the plate is level by placing the ball on the plate and ensuring it does not move. Save the offsets with the `s` key and then close the level plate program with the `q` key.


You can always view the servo offset values on your Moab by navigating to and selecting HUE INFO.
